# PGCS -- Public Grievance Clearing System

The Project “Public Grievance Clearing System” is a web based application to improve the Functionalities of various consumer departments. The process of centralizing different departments is a difficult task. To minimize the confusion and maximize the easiness we centralize the complaint sections of different departments. It makes it easier to give complaints to the various departments like water, gas, electricity, telephone based on the consumer’s problem. There is also provision of paying the bills of the departments mentioned above. If a consumer wants to give a complaint, they first register into the site using their Aadhaar card number. It consists of users such as consumers, department heads and employees.

   It provides facility of department login through which the department head can monitor the whole system. He can view the complaint and allot a worker to maintain the complaint. Worker can view the complaints by login their account using worker id and can update his status like time, date of maintaining etc. and also can update the working details like is the work completed or pending or work in progress. When he updates the status, the user can view the updates, and user can also get a confirmation mail during the time of complaint booking. It has also a facility where user after logging their account can see the complaint status. There also a module for paying bills, on this user can select departments and this will lead to corresponding payment gateways.


## Existing System
   Departments deals with different day-to-day activities that take place generally in any system. In the existing manual system huge expenditure and a lot of time is spent in communicating the information across different branches.  So, there is a need for an integrated automated system, which has some centralized control over the entire process.
